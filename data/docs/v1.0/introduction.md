# Introduction (v1.0)

VectorDB is a document database with vector search capabilities. It stores JSON documents, each with a required embedding vector, and supports similarity search with optional metadata filters.

In v1.0 the focus is on predictable core behavior: stable indexing, deterministic query ranking, and simple operational knobs. The API is intentionally small so that teams can validate retrieval quality before adopting more advanced features.

The database organizes data into collections. Each collection owns its own index, so latency and recall scale with the size of that collection rather than the entire cluster. Embeddings are stored alongside metadata to enable hybrid filtering and traceability of results.

Conceptual model:
- A document is a JSON object with an `id`, an `embedding`, and optional `metadata`.
- An embedding is a fixed-length vector of floats generated by a model outside VectorDB.
- A collection groups documents and defines an index for nearest-neighbor search.
- A query is a vector plus optional filters; the system returns the most similar documents.

Design goals:
- Explainable results: provide scores and metadata to reason about ranking.
- Operational clarity: make configuration explicit and defaults safe.
- Forward compatibility: keep storage and query semantics stable across minor versions.
